#Senior Design Robotic Controller
##A velocity controlled h-bridge servo driver for the Teensy++

###Quick, Build Requirements
- `sudo apt-get install avr-gcc avr-libc` OR for OSX: `sudo port install avr-gcc avr-libc` OR [search for it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=avr-gcc+avr-libc). 
- `make`
- [Teensy load it.](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)

Not sure how it works to compile anything ANSI on windoze. I think you'll need [cygwin](http://cygwin.com/). Good luck (and get a POSIX system!). 
###Why?
Our senior design project was tasked with building a robotic arm. So build one we did. 
Check out our project page on [google sites](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/robot-manipulator-arm/). 
###How?
I designed the 5-6 link robot arm in solidworks (hurray education licenses!) so that it could be 3D printed and laser cut. The motors are [sail-winch servos](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=20854) from hobbyking. Every joint is held by a cheap skateboard bearing and the entire structure is solid and strong. 
###Project Requirements
Want to build one? You'll need:
- [Teensy++](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy)
- [H-bridge (x3)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/315)
- [sail-winch servos (x5)](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=20854)
- Laser cutter
- 3D Printer 
- Patience and soldering skills
